The algorithms covers full-text search engines, which allow people to 
search a large set of documents for a list of words, and which rank 
results according to how relevant the documents are to those words. 

Which also includes google most famous PageRank Algorithm
Although the main purpose of the demo is focused on algorithm:
The necessary steps tp crawl, index (not necessary to create a big 
table in databse at this pointm but create a reference such as 
a file system path or URL)and rank the list of docs indexed from 
a querry.

The evaluation metric the the raning quality could be vary:
1. word freq based on the content of page
2. Page-ranked algorithm based on information external to the content
of the page.

In the final part, we'll build a simple neural network for ranking queries.
